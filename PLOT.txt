It was a boring sunday.Alan decided to go out to get some fresh air 
then all of a sudden he gets a phone call from an unknown number...
Alan decided to lift up the call. "Hello?". He heard no response. "Hello?....Hello?".
Then all of a sudden he heard strange noises, it sounded like an interrogation. "Tell me where it is, or else...",
"Please- please dont kill me....i dont know, i honestly dont know....i got a family...plea-".
the suddenly Alan heard two gunshots and an intense yell from the guy. They must have butt-dialed him somehow,
but now Alan was a witness to something he wouldnt have guessed would happen.Alan was completely scared,
the decision he made to get some fresh air, turned out be more intense and he approached to a police station
by an intiative to inform them about the incident,after that
